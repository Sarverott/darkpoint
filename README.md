# Darkpoint
---

This Python framework is technomantic mnemonic toolkit of thought model system with singular principles that allows to create memory palace with start placing in darkness.

### thought model system overview

This is my personal way of thinking, that as natural mechanism is my default non-verbal thought behaviour. It's automatic and acts as my lowest-level coding method of mindsets. After years in process of clearyfication through trial and error I learned to explain how I'm thinking and why perspective of mine can sometimes terrifyingly stand out from other people. I uses simplifying and metaphores to define in the readers' imagination basic core of things and fundamental rules how it works. This `README.md` document is in my opinion still not enought clear, but i hope that soon I finally figure out how to close full fundations of mechanic's ruleset in human words.

### singular principles

These are basic rules that are essential 

- **Points have hooks:** Each piece of information is represented as a point that has a hook.
- **On the end of hooks are next points:** The hooks lead to additional points, creating a chain of information.
- **Every point is information:** Each point represents a specific piece of information.
- **Informations are related by hooking:** The connections between points are established through hooks.
- **Hooks are one-directional:** The connections only go in one direction, leading from one point to another with evental resulting nature, not dimentional.
- **Points can be extended by templates:** Each point can have additional context or details added through templates.
- **Set starting point:** There is a designated starting point from which the connections begin.
- **For __The PALACE__ there is special starting point:** this is root placed in the middle of memories, every time after reset or starting, the point of focus lands here. For example my palace is: `dark void` and reset for me runs through simply thinking about `darkness`.
- **All templates to work properly have to be accessible from the starting point:** These are declared as points too so all relevant information have be reached from the starting point.


### Examples

```python
print("darkpoint") #comment
```
